# Project : Classification II | Foundations of Modern Machine Learning Project

This mini-project tries to solve the computer-vision task of identifying the number of fingers held up in front of a camera using fundamental and basic ML Algorithms. The intent is to explain and teach the pros and cons of learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machine. These algorithms have been tranined on the same dataset and are being compared in terms of their performance in predicting the classes. This repo is a part of the course offered by iHub, IIIT Hyderabad Foundations of Modern Machine Learning 2022.
